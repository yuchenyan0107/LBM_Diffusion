# Configuration
Set up your first simulation with *Musubi*.

This tutorial is using a 1D gaussian_pulse in pressure computed in a 3D domain.
The necessary configuration file to run this case will be generated from
scratch within this tutorial.
The final config-file for this case can be found in
`examples/tutorials/tutorial_cases/tutorial_gaussian_pulse/`.

## The musubi.lua File ##

We communicate with *Musubi* via a Lua-Script that tells *Musubi* what we
want to simulate and which options we want to set.
The Lua-syntax is fairly easy, and for this tutorial, we will use only a
small subset of it, so don't be afraid if you hear of Lua for the first time.

By default, *Musubi* looks for a file called `musubi.lua` inside your current
working directory. If you want, you can use different names (for example if
you want to keep more than one script e.g. `musubi_test.lua`) and pass the name
of the script you want the application to use as a command-line argument.
(e.g.`~/apes/musubi/build/musubi musubi_test.lua`)

We are now going to build a working, almost-minimal `musubi.lua` file
step-by-step.
Please navigate to your simulation directory, and create a new file called
`musubi.lua` with your favorite text editor.

@note Most configuration options have some sane defaults, which allows you to
leave them alone if they are not relevant to you.

@note Before you run the following simulation setup, make sure that you have
created the subdirectories `restart` and `tracking` in the same path where
`musubi.lua` is located.

### Lua concepts for the configuration

Lua provides a convenient data structure called
[tables](http://www.lua.org/pil/2.5.html), that we use extensively in the
configuration to structure it.
Tables allow us to gather relevant settings together.
They are indicated by curly brackets `{}`.
Thus, we can define a table like this:

```lua
atable = { somevalue = 123 }
```

Note that tables can be nested and values inside the table can be themselves
be tables again.
We can have an arbitrary amount of values in the table definition and individual
settings are separated by comma (`,`), like this:

```lua
atable = {
  somevalue = 123,
  anothervalue = "abc"
}
```

A superfluous comma at the end of the last entry is also valid syntax here.

Alternatively, we can also modify or add values to an existing table via the
dot operator:

```lua
atable.somevalue = 42
atable.third = 1.23
```

Here we modify `somvalue` in the `atable` table and add a `third` entry
with the value `1.23` to the table.

Comments in Lua are introduced by two dashes (`--`). We also make use of
these to offer explanations to the settings in the configuration scripts.

@note
The complete configuration file is executed and the status of the various
settings "at the end" of that execution is what Musubi will obtain.
@endnote

## General Simulation Name ##

Every simulation should have a name, which is specified by the variable
`simulation_name` in the Lua script.

In this example, we will simulate a
[Gaussian pulse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_function 'Wikipedia: Gaussian Pulse')
in pressure, hence the name *Gausspulse* seems adequate.
You can use just anything as a simulation name, just make it clear and
descriptive, as it will help you to identify produced results from the
simulation.

@note
The simulation name will appear in all output files, so if you use good
and unique names, you always know where a particular output came from.
@endnote

```lua
simulation_name = 'Gausspulse'
```

## Fluid table ##

Musubi requires us to define the properties of the fluid to simulate in
a `fluid` table.
In that table we define the kinematic viscosity in the variable
`kinematic_viscosity`:

```lua
fluid = {
  kinematic_viscosity = 1.2e-6
}
```

In the incompressible model this is already enough to define the fluid.
For weakly compressible models, we also need to provide the bulk viscosity
in the variable `bulk_viscosity`:

```lua
fluid = {
  kinematic_viscosity = 1.2e-6
}
fluid.bulk_viscosity = 2*fluid.kinematic_viscosity/3
```

Notice how we defined the second entry here in dependency of the first.
This is not possible when defining all entries in the table directly, thus
we are using a separate line after the first definition of the table
to set the bulk viscosity.

One question that arises in setting the values in the fluid table, but
also in other settings like the initial conditions, boundary conditions or source
terms, is in what units those values are to be provided.

The solver works on so called lattice units, which are tied to the discretization.
However, that often is a little cumbersome to work with and it also provides
the possibility to instead translate the given quantities from physical
units.
To that end the user has to provide a `physics` table.
When provided by the user that table will be used by Musubi to convert
given fluid property settings to the internal lattice units for the computation.
It will also be used to translate results back to physical units in variable
names that have a `_phy` suffix.
Thus, when you want to refer obtain the resulting velocity field from the
computation you would access the `velocity_phy` variable, which provides the
velocity converted with the help of the settings in the `physics` table.

## Physics table ##

The `physics` table provides the necessary quantities to transform physical units
to the lattice units used by the solver internally.
Specifically it applies to the `fluid.kinematic_viscosity` setting and macroscopic
variables like `pressure` and `velocity` used in the definition of boundary and
initial conditions.

As described above, these parameters/variables can be defined either in physical units
or lattice (non-dimensional) units.
But they can not be mixed i.e. some in physical and others in lattice units.
It is important that they are consistent. 

Two settings describe space and time: the edge length of the coarsest elements
in the grid (`dx`) and the step length of the time steps of those elements
(`dt`).
While `dx` is given by the mesh definition, the time step length has to be
derived differently.
Usually, this is achieved by providing the physical speed of sound `cs` of the
fluid in the physics table.
Musubi computes the time step length via the relation
$dt = dx * cs_{lat} / cs$, where $cs_{lat}=\sqrt{1/3}$.
the physics table for the conversion between lattice and physical units.
Alternatively, `dt` on the coarsest level itself may be provided in the physics
table, which implies a speed of sound according to the relation above.
Note, that for a fixed physical speed of sound, the time step length is
proportional to the element edge lengths.
In case of multilevels this relation is maintained and the time step size
scales along with the mesh element sizes.

Finally, we need to define either the mean density `rho0` of the fluid or the 
fluid mass `mass0` in the coarsest elements. 
Providing the mass is more natural when simulating multiple species, as we can
work with the respective mass fractions in that case.
Otherwise, we usually describe the mean density.
Both, `cs` (or `dt` on the coarsest level) and a measure for the mass have to
be provided in the `physics` table.
Thus, a minimal `physics` table should look like this:

```lua
physics = {
  cs = 330.0,
  rho0 = 1.0
}
```

In Musubi, the following reference values are used to convert
parameters/variables in physical units to lattice units and vice-versa: 

| Measure      | Unit     | Reference          | Notation. | Name in physics table | Default value |
|:------------:|:--------:|:------------------:|:---------:|:---------------------:|:-------------:|
| Mass         | $kg$     | fluid mass         | $m_{ref}$    | `mass0`            | $rho0\times dx^3$  |
| Density      | $kg/m^3$ | mean fluid density | $\rho_{ref}$ | `rho0`             | $mass0/dx^3$  |
| Length       | $m$      | coarsest element   | $dx_{ref}$   | Not required | is taken from mesh  |
| Time         | $s$      | coarsest time step size | $dt_{ref}$   | `dt`             | -                     |
| Amount of substance | $mol$ | Inverse of Avagadro's number  | $N_A$ | `mole0`       | $1/6.02214129e^{-23}$ |
| Mole density | $mol/m^3$ | mean mole density | $c_{ref}$    | `moleDens0`           | $1/(N_A dx^3)$        |
| Molecular weight | $kg/mol$ | Largest molecular weight of species| $M_{ref}$ | `molWeight0` | $mass0/mole0$ |
| Temperature  | $K$      | fluid temperature  | $T_{ref}$    | `temp0`               | 1.0                   |
| Electric charge | $C$    | fundamental electric charge | $q_{ref}$ | `coulomb0`     | $1.60217657e^{-19}$   |

As shown in the table most of them have default values and the coarsest element size (`dx`)
is taken from the mesh.
Thus the physics table provided above offers the minimal, but also usual
setting for most cases.

The non-dimensional lattice units (subscript l) are scaled to one for the computation
by choosing the provided physical units (subscript p) provided in the physics table also
as the reference values (subscript ref):

- Lattice density, $\rho_{l} = \frac{\rho_{p}}{\rho_{ref}} = 1.0$
- Lattice element size, $dx_{l} = \frac{dx_p}{dx_{ref}} = 1.0$
- Lattice time step, $dt_{l} = \frac{dt_p}{dt_{ref}} = 1.0$ and so on.

All other derived variables in lattice units are converted to physical units
using the reference variables in physical units. 
For simplicity, the subscript 'ref' is dropped in the equations below for the reference values:

- Lattice pressure $p_l$ to physical pressure, $p_p = p_l * \frac{\rho \cdot dx^2}{dt^2}$ $[kg/m/s^2]$
- Lattice velocity $u_l$ to physical velocity, $u_p = u_l * \frac{dx}{dt}$ $[m/s]$
- Lattice kinematic viscosity to physical kinematic viscosity, $\nu_p = \nu_l * \frac{dx^2}{dt}$ $[m^2/s]$
- Lattice force $f_l$ to physical force, $f_p = f_l * \frac{\rho \cdot dx^4}{dt^2}$ $[kg m/s^2]$
- Lattice current $I_l$ to physical current, $I_p = I_l * \frac{q}{dt}$ $[C/s]$
- Lattice potential $\phi_l$ to physical potential, $\phi_p = \phi_l * \frac{\rho \cdot  dx^5}{q \cdot dt^2}$ $[kg m^2 /(C s^2)=V]$

For more on the unit conversion for other derived variables refer to 
[mus_physics_module(module)].

All physical quantities set in the configuration are affected by these
conversions.
This includes the settings in the `fluid`, `species` and `mixture` tables,
aswell as the macroscopic variables in the `initial_condition`, `boundary_condition` and `source`
tables.

Now, usually we do not really care about the timestep width, but rather
want to compute this from the other fluid properties.
By using a Lua script for the configuration, we can easily define those
relations by defining appropiate variables and compute the needed variables
for the Musubi settings.

For example like this:

```lua
-- Flow parameters
-- Mach number
Ma = 0.05
-- Reynolds number of the flow
Re = 60
-- speed of sound in air [m/s]
cs_phy = 343
-- Density of the fluid [kg/m^3]
rho0_phy = 1.0
-- Ambient pressure [kg/(m s^2)]
press_ambient_phy = rho0_phy*cs_phy^2
```

For convenience, a suffix '_phy' and '_lat' are used to represent variables in 
physical and lattice units respectively.
In Musubi, the flow is considered to be isothermal. For a perfect ideal gas,
the pressure is related to the speed of sound as i.e. $p = \rho c^2_s$.

The lattice speed of sound is fixed to $c_{s,lat} = \sqrt{(1/3)}$

```lua
-- Lattice speed of sound
cs_lat = math.sqrt(1.0/3.0)
```

Finally, the physical time step size $dt$ required in the `physics` table.
It is computed either by acoustic or diffusive scaling.
In acoustic scaling, the time step $dt$ is computed from the speed of sound or 
velocity so that the Mach ($Ma$) number is fixed across different element sizes. 
Thus, when conducting grid convergence studies with 
acoustic scaling, the Mach number, lattice speed of sound and lattice velocity 
remain constant while the lattice viscosity `nu_lat``and relaxation parameter 
`omega` ($\omega$) changes.

```lua
-- Inflow velocity computed from Ma number [m/s]
vel_phy = Ma * cs_phy
-- Kinematic viscosity of the fluid calculated from Re [m^2/s]
nu_phy = vel_phy * height / Re
-- Lattice velocity
vel_lat = Ma * cs_lat
-- Physical timestep computed from physical and lattice speed of sound
dt  = cs_lat / cs_phy * dx
-- Lattice viscosity
nu_lat  = nu_phy*dt /dx^2
-- Relaxation parameter
omega   = 1.0/(nu_lat/cs_lat^2 + 0.5)

```

On the other hand, in diffuive scaling, the time step $dt$ is computed from 
the kinematic viscosity so that the lattice kinematic viscosity `nu_lat` 
and the relaxation parameter `omega` ($\omega$) are fixed across the element 
sizes while the Mach number $Ma$ and lattice velocity $vel_lat$ changes. 

```lua
-- In diffusive scaling, Kinematic viscosity and omega are fixed by user
-- Kinematic viscosity of the fluid [m^2/s]
nu_phy = 0.285
-- Inflow velocity is computed from Re and viscosity [m/s]
vel_phy = Re * nu_phy / height
-- Relaxation parameter
omega   = 1.7
-- Lattice viscosity
nu_lat  = ( 1.0/omega - 0.5 ) / 3.0
-- Physical timestep computed from physical and lattice velocity
dt = nu_lat/nu_phy*dx*dx
-- Lattice velocity
vel_lat = vel_phy*dt/dx
-- Mach number
Ma = vel_lat * cs_lat

```

@note 
Most of the variables mentioned above are local variables.
we need `rho0_phy` and `dt` to define variables in physical units in the `physics` 
table, `nu_phy` to define the fluid property in the `fluid` table,
and `press_ambient_phy` and `vel_phy` to define initial and boundary conditions
in `initial_condition` and `boundary_condition` tables.
@endnote

In simple words, with acoustic scaling, the time step size $dt$ is reduced by 
half when the element size $dx$ is reduced by half i.e. $dt \propto dx$ but 
with diffusive scaling, the time step size $dt$ is reduced to one-fourth i.e.
$dt \propto dx^2$.

With those definitions in place you can then define the physics table with
the help of those variables:

```lua
physics = {
  dt = dt,
  rho0 = rho0_phy
}
```

And of course also the fluid table:

```lua
fluid = {
  kinematic_viscosity = nu_phy
}
```

When physical units are not of interest and you would like to just run a simulation
by defining lattice units, remove the `physics` table from the Musubi
configuration file. In this case, the variables are then defined in lattice units

```lua
-- Relaxation parameter
omega = 1.8
-- Background density in lattice unit
rho0 = 1.0
-- Lattice speed of sound
cs = math.sqrt(1/3.0)
-- Background pressure in lattice unit
p0 = rho0*cs^2
-- Kinematic viscosity in lattice unit
nu = ( 1.0/omega - 0.5 ) / 3.0
```

@note
Musubi can dump output variables in physical units. 
It just requires a suffix '_phy' to the variable name in tracking table.
@endnote


## Time Settings ##

Now we should specify the number of timesteps for our simulation.
We do this by opening a `time` section with at least the variable `max`
given to specify the maximal number of timesteps you want to simulate.
Additionally, you might provide the `interval`-setting, that controls the
debug output: after a predefinded number of iterations, the total density of
the system is calculated and written to the console, this defaults to 1.
The number of iterations can be set by using `{iter=#}` to set the number of
iterations. Alternative one can use `{sim=#}` to trigger the check after certain
timesteps in your simulation or use `{clock=#}` to trigger the check after a
certain runtime. Since we have conservation of mass, the total density should
not change much, so if it does, it is a hint for the user that the results of
the simulation are probably wrong. Setting the interval to something around
`[max/10]` is reasonable.

```lua
sim_control = {
  time_control = {
    max = {iter=50},
    interval = {iter=5}
  }
}
```

## Identification ##

It should be followed by a part that identifies the nature of the simulation.
To this part belong the following aspects: the `layout`, the `kind` and the
`relaxation`. For now, it is not necessary to know these settings in detail.
you can choose between some values that you can look up in the
[[mus_scheme_header_module]].
If these settings are not defined, *Musubi* will use default values.
As a first example, you can set up the identify table as:

```lua
identify = {
  kind  = 'fluid',
  layout = 'd3q19',
  relaxation = 'bgk',
}
```

## Geometry ##

The geometry is usually a more complicated thing to define. For anything
but the simplest case, we need *Seeder*, a tool that will be dealt with
in the [next tutorial chapter](tut_02_mus_toolchain.html).
For now, we will use a pre-defined geometry, which is just a simple cube
with periodic boundaries and no obstacles. We can specify the `length`
and position (`origin`) of that cube. The position of the cube is only
relevant if you specify positions of other objects, too, such as
initial conditions or *trackers* (we will explain what that is in
[chapter_03](tut_03_tracking.html)).

Last but not least, the `refinementLevel` tells *Musubi* how fine the
initial `cube` (with a length of 10 here) needs to be discretized. A refinement
level of `4` means that our initial cube is cut into \( 2^4 \) portions in
each dimension, which leaves us with \( 2^{3\cdot4} \) cells in `3` dimensions.

```lua
mesh = {
  predefined = 'cube',
  origin = { 0.0, 0.0, 0.0 },
  length = 10.0,
  refinementLevel = 4
}
```

@warning Lua is case-sensitve, and some *Musubi* options (like `refinementLevel`)
have to be written in camelCase.

## Tracking ##

Of course you do not only want to simulate, you also want to see results.
The `tracking` section is your way to control some subset output from *Musubi*.
The idea behind it is that for any real-life scale problem, you just
cannot save all the information of every point at every timestep,
since the shear amount of data would be too much to handle. Thus, we
tell *Musubi* what we want to see (like pressure, velocity...), at what
time, and in what position.

Each output is handled by a *tracker*. Let us define a *tracker* now, step
by step.
First, a *tracker* has a name (specified in `label`) that will appear in
every output file created by this *tracker*. Anything that is precise and
meaningful will do.

```lua
tracking = {
  label = 'track_pressure',
```

Next, we should tell the *tracker* what we are interested in. The `variable`
section will do just that for us. In this example, we will ask the *tracker*
to store density and velocity information for us.

The output will be stored on your hard drive, in the location you specify
in `folder`.

@warning You have to create the folder yourself *before* you start the
simulation. If it doesn't exist, *Musubi* will crash with a Fortran runtime error.

```lua
  variable = { 'pressure', 'velocity' },
  folder = './tracking/',
```

The most complicated part is the [[tem_shape_module]] variable.
It defines *where* inside
the simulation domain (which is a cube in our example) you want to observe the
variables. You can take samples at a point, along a line, everywhere on a plane,
or even everywhere inside a given box. These options will be discussed in more
depth in [chapter_03](tut_03_tracking.html).
For now, we are happy with a point at position `(1,1,1)`:

```lua
  shape = {
    kind = 'canoND',
    object = {origin = {1.0, 1.0, 1.0} }
  },
```

The `format` option lets you choose the file format in which the data
should be stored. The options you have are `ascii`, `asciiSpatial` and `vtk`.
`Ascii` is only really usable for point *trackers*. For anything more
sophisticated (starting in the next chapter), we will use the build-in tool
`mus_harvesting` for post-processing the data.

```lua
  output = {format = 'ascii'},
```

Finally, we have to specify at which timesteps we want to save data.
Inside the `time` section, you can specify the first (`min`) and last
(`max`) timestep that is of interest to you. If `[max]` is negative,
every timestep till the end will be considered. In `interval`, you can
choose if you want to save every timestep (set it to `1` then) or only
every `[n]`-th timestep (set `interval` to `n` in this case).
<!-- anchor to jump up here from result -->
<div id="track_control"></div>
```lua
  time_control = { min = {iter=1}, max = {iter=50}, interval = {iter=1} },
}
```
Don't forget to close the `tracking` section with another curly brace.

## Restart ##

In the `restart` part of your `musubi.lua` file you can create so-called restart
files in order to save the results of your simulation. With these restart files
you can create vtk files with `mus_harvesting` to view them in Paraview. In
addition to that, you can also read the restart files to go on with your
simulation beginning at the saved point written in the restart files. In the
"restart" section you are also able to use `time_control` to define the `min`,
`max` and the `interval` time, when *Musubi* writes a restart file to the
`restart/` folder. Be sure that you set up useful definitions for that. For
example, you can set up the restart settings like this:

```lua
restart = {
  write = 'restart/',   -- prefix to write the files to
  time_control = { min = 0, max = 10, interval = 10}  -- timing definitions (either iterations or simulation time)
}
```
@note You have to create the `restart` folder within your simulation folder at
first.
So far, these are only basic information about `restart`.
Further information about the restart are explained in
[Tutorial 5: Restart](tut_05_restart.html).

## Initial Conditions ##
Initial conditions can be specified in the `initial_condition` table.
First, let us define that the velocity at `t=0` should be `0` everywhere.

But if every point is equal, not much is going to happen. So for the
initial pressure, we will do something more fancy: We will define a function
`gausspulse` that will set the initial pressure such that it has a peak
in the middle of the domain, and decreases quickly towards the sides.
With this, we will create two waves running from the center towards both
sides. The `initial_condition`-table will point to this function for the
density:

```lua
initial_condition = {
  velocityX = 0.0,
  velocityY = 0.0,
  velocityZ = 0.0,
  pressure  = gausspulse
}
```
The function can be defined like this in the Lua script:
```lua
function gausspulse(x, y, z)
  originX =  5.0
  halfwidth = 1.0
  amplitude = 0.01
  return p0+amplitude*math.exp(-0.5/(halfwidth^2)*( x - originX )^2)
end
```
@warning Define the function before the `initial_condition` table or you will receive an error whilst
running *Musubi*.
@endwarning

Moreover,define the `p0` as global variable in the function.
So that it will return the function like `p0+amplitude*math.exp(-0.5/halfwidth^2)*(x-originX)^2`:

```lua
rho0 = 1.
cs2 = 1./3.
p0 = rho0*cs2
```

@note A last short remark on variables: If you do something more complicated
in your `musubi.lua` script, you are of course free to use functions,
variables, loops, branches, whatever you want.
The only thing that counts is what is defined after running your script.
Be careful, however, when using your own variables, as you might set *Musubi*
options that you are not aware of.
It might be wise to use variables only inside your own functions,
or at least give them some prefix so you don't confuse your own variables
with *Musubi* options.
@endnote

@note
An important remark on the pressure variable. It is a total pressure irrespective 
of `fluid` and `fluid_incompressible`. So if pressure flucations are required
to compute the acoustic waves then they can be obtained by calculating a
difference between numerical pressure computed from simulation and 
ambient pressure defined in initial/boundary condition.
@endnote

## Result ##

If you did all steps correct you're now able to run the test case. If something
is not working you can compare your config file with our template you can find
under: `examples/tutorials/tutorial_cases/tutorial_gaussian_pulse/musubi.lua`.
After finishing your run, you will find an output file called
`Gausspulse_track_pressure_p00000.res` in your `tracking`-folder.
If you open it, you will find densities and velocities for every iteration.
If you choose an other `interval` in [tracking-table](#track_control)
(for example `iter=5`), the values for every choosen iteration
(e.g. every 5th iteration) will be listed here.

@note The Ascii output is used only in this first tutorial. You can visualize
this data with any program you like, for example with
[Gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info), if you
have it installed. If not, wait for the next chapter, as we are going to
introduce different tools there, anyway.
Simply run Gnuplot with:

```sh
gnuplot -p -e "plot \"tracking/Gausspulse_track_pressure_p00000.res\" using 1:2"
```
to get a plot of the pressure similar to this one:

![pulse_point](images/pulse_point.png "Several pressure pulses hitting the point tracker")

The picture shows the pulse running through your point *tracker* several
times. This happens because of the periodic boundaries. The intensity of
the pulse decreases due to dissipation.

In the next chapter, we will learn to define more complex geometries, and
to create more sophisticated outputs.
